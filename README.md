✨ **zkSync Checker** ✨  
**Advanced Airdrop Tracking & Security Suite for zkSync Era**  

---

### 🌍 **Why zkSync Checker?**  
As **zkSync Era** emerges as Ethereum’s fastest-growing Layer-2 (zkEVM-powered, 2,000+ TPS), airdrops and DeFi incentives are exploding. But with opportunity comes **scams, complex eligibility rules, and gas fee traps**.  

**zkSync Checker** solves this by combining:  
- 🚨 **Real-time airdrop discovery** for zkSync-native projects (e.g., ZigZag, Maverick, SyncSwap).  
- 🔍 **Deep contract audits** to detect malicious code in zkEVM bytecode.  
- ⚡ **Gas fee optimization** to reduce claiming/bridging costs by 30-50%.

### 🔥 **Core Features**  
#### **1. Airdrop Intelligence**  
✅ **Multi-Source Tracking**: Monitor incentives from zkSync Foundation, Ethereum Layer-2 reward programs, and DeFi protocols.  
✅ **Eligibility Engine**: Scan transaction history for airdrop triggers (e.g., "Your 10+ swaps on ZigZag qualify for $ZIG airdrop").  
✅ **Cross-Chain Sync**: Check eligibility for ETH-Layer 2 cross-chain rewards (e.g., Optimism retroactive drops).  

#### **2. Security Layer**  
✅ **Phishing Shield**: Block fake websites impersonating zkSync (e.g., "zksync-official.app" → flagged).  
✅ **Contract Auditor**: Reverse-engineer zkEVM bytecode to detect hidden mint functions or reentrancy risks.  
✅ **Approval Guardian**: Flag risky token approvals that could drain your ETH/zkSync wallet.  

#### **3. Gas Optimization**  
✅ **Fee Predictor**: Estimate gas costs for claiming airdrops or bridging funds to/from Ethereum.  
✅ **Batch Transactions**: Bundle multiple claims into a single transaction to save fees.  
✅ **MEV Protection**: Detect and avoid frontrunning risks during airdrop claims.  

#### **4. Developer Tools**  
✅ **zkEVM Decompiler**: Analyze low-level bytecode for advanced users.  
✅ **API Integration**: Fetch airdrop data for wallets/dApps via REST endpoints.  
✅ **Bulk Scanner**: Check 1,000+ addresses at once for DAO governance rewards.

### 🛠️ **Technical Deep Dive**  
- **Languages**: Rust (zkEVM analysis), TypeScript (API), Python (ML for airdrop patterns).  
- **zkSync Tools**: zkSync Era SDK, zkEVM disassembler, Layer-2 explorer integration.  
- **Security**: Zero private key storage, encrypted RPC calls, community-curated scam database.  

---

### 🎯 **Use Cases**  
- **DeFi Users**: Track airdrops from SyncSwap, Maverick, or zkLend.  
- **NFT Collectors**: Claim rewards from zkSync NFT platforms (e.g., ZK NFT Hub).  
- **Ethereum Degens**: Migrate to zkSync while qualifying for cross-chain rewards.  
- **Validators/Builders**: Audit airdrop fairness or integrate data into dApps.  

---

### 🌌 **Why It’s Unique**  
- **zkEVM Focus**: Unlike generic tools, we specialize in zkSync’s zero-knowledge proofs.  
- **Gas Efficiency**: Save 30-50% on fees with smart transaction batching.  
- **Community-Powered**: 500+ scams flagged by users in our open database.
